# Problem 326: Power of Three

Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

### Example 1:

Input: head = [1,0,1]
Output: 5

Explanation: Output = (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10

### Example 2:

Input: head = [0]
Output: 0

### Example 3:

Input: head = [1]
Output: 1

### Example 4:

Input: head = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: 18880

### Example 5:

Input: head = [0,0]
Output: 0
