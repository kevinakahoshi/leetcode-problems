    <h1>Problem 860: Lemonade Change</h1>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs <code>$5.</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you, and order one at a time (in the order specified by
      <code>bills</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a <code>$5</code>, <code>$10</code>, or
      <code>$20</code> bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer, so that the net transaction
      is that the customer pays $5.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that you don't have any change in hand at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Return <code>true</code> if and only if you can provide every customer with correct change.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Example 1:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="code-block">Input: [5,5,5,10,20]
Output: true
Explanation:
From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
Since all customers got correct change, we output true.</pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Example 2:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="code-block">Input: [5,5,10]
Output: true</pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Example 3:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="code-block">Input: [10,10]
Output: false</pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Example 4:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="code-block">Input: [5,5,10,10,20]
Output: false
Explanation:
From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills.
For the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.
For the last customer, we can't give change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.
Since not every customer received correct change, the answer is false.</pre>

      <strong>Note:</strong>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>0 <= bills.length <=10000</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>bills[i]</code> will be either <code>5</code>, <code>10</code>, or <code>20</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>
