    <h1>Problem 1431: Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies</h1>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Given the array <code>candies</code> and the integer <code>extraCandies</code>, where <code>candies[i]</code>
      represents the number of candies that the <strong><em>ith</em></strong> kid has.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each kid check if there is a way to distribute <code>extraCandies</code> among the kids such that he or she
      can have the <strong>greatest</strong> number of candies among them. Notice that multiple kids can have the
      <strong>greatest</strong> number of candies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Example 1:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre
      class="code-block">Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true]
Explanation:
Kid 1 has 2 candies and if he or she receives all extra candies (3) will have 5 candies --- the greatest number of candies among the kids.
Kid 2 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids.
Kid 3 has 5 candies and this is already the greatest number of candies among the kids.
Kid 4 has 1 candy and even if he or she receives all extra candies will only have 4 candies.
Kid 5 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids. </pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Example 2:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre
      class="code-block">Input: candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
Output: [true,false,false,false,false]
Explanation: There is only 1 extra candy, therefore only kid 1 will have the greatest number of candies among the kids
regardless of who takes the extra candy.</pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Example 3:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="code-block">Input: candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10
Output: [true,false,true]</pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Constraints:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>
            2 <= candies.length <=100
          </code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>
            1 <= candies[i] <=100
          </code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>
            1 <= extraCandies <=50
          </code>
        </li>
      </ul>
