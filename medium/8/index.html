    <h1>Problem 8: String to Integer (atoi)</h1>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Implement <code>atoi</code> which converts a string to an integer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is
      found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many
      numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.
    </p>
    <p>
      The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have
      no effect on the behavior of this function.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence
      exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Note:
      </strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Only the space character <code>' '</code> is considered as whitespace character.</li>
        <li>Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer
          range: [−2<sup>31</sup>, 2<sup>31 − 1</sup>]. If the numerical value is out of the range of representable
          values, INT_MAX (2<sup>31 − 1</sup>) or INT_MIN (−2<sup>31</sup>) is returned.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Example 1:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre
    class="code-block">Input: "42"<br />Output: 42</pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Example 2:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre
      class="code-block">Input: " -42"<br />Output: -42<br />Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is '-', which is the minus sign.
Then take as many numerical digits as possible, which gets 42.</pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Example 3:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre
      class="code-block">Input: "4193 with words"<br />Output: 4193<br />Explanation: Conversion stops at digit '3' as the next character is not a numerical digit.</pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Example 4:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="code-block">Input: "words and 987"<br />Output: 0<br />Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is 'w',
which is not a numerical digit or a +/- sign. Therefore no valid conversion could be performed.</pre>
    <p>
      <strong>Example 5:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre
      class="code-block">Input: "-91283472332"<br />Output: -2147483648<br />Explanation: The number "-91283472332" is out of the r
ange of a 32-bit signed integer. Thefore INT_MIN (−231) is returned.</pre>
